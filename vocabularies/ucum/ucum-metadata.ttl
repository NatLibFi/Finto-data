	dc:description """
The Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) is a code system intended to include all units of measures being contemporarily used in international science, engineering, and business. The purpose is to facilitate unambiguous electronic communication of quantities together with their units. The focus is on electronic communication, as opposed to communication between humans. A typical application of The Unified Code for Units of Measure are electronic data interchange (EDI) protocols, but there is nothing that prevents it from being used in other types of machine communication.

UCUM is based on the ISO 80000: 2009 Quantities and Units standards series that specify the use of System International (SI) units in publications. ISO 80000 standards series is developed by Technical Committee 12, International Organization of Standardization (ISO/TC12) Quantities and units in co-operation with Technical Committee 25, International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC/TC 25).

This is a SKOS version of the original UCUM, which can be found here: http://unitsofmeasure.org/trac
